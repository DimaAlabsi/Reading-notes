#  Graphs

**terminology used when working with Graphs:**

* Vertex - A vertex, also called a “node”, is a data object that can have zero or more adjacent vertices.
* Edge - An edge is a connection between two nodes.
Neighbor - The neighbors of a node are its adjacent nodes, i.e., are connected via an edge.
* Degree - The degree of a vertex is the number of edges connected to that vertex.

* A graph is a non-linear kind of data structure made up of nodes or vertices and edges. The edges connect any two nodes in the graph, and the nodes are also known as vertices

### Directed vs Undirected

* Directed Graphs (Digraph)
A Directed Graph also called a Digraph is a graph where every edge is directed.

* An Undirected Graph is a graph where each edge is undirected or bi-directional. This means that the undirected graph does not move in any direction.
