 ### Operators and Loops
 
 
 #### Operators


###### JavaScript has the following types of operators. This section describes the operators and contains information about operator precedence.

* Assignment operators

* Comparison operators

| Operator   |      description    |  example |
|----------|:-------------:|---------: |
| Equal (==) . |  	Returns true if the operands are equal |3 == var1 "3" == var1  3 == '3' |

* Arithmetic operators

* Bitwise operators

|  Operator 		  |  Usage          | Description  |
|----------|:-------------:|------:|
| Bitwise AND 	 |  a & b  | 	Returns a one in each bit position for which the corresponding bits of both operands are ones. |
| Bitwise OR 	. |   a\b   |  	Returns a zero in each bit position for which the corresponding bits of both operands are zeros |

* Logical operators
* String operators
* Conditional (ternary) operator
* Comma operator
* Unary operators
* Relational operators


## Loops and iteration

There are many different kinds of loops, but they all essentially do the same thing: they repeat an action some number of times. (Note that it's possible that number could be zero!)

The various loop mechanisms offer different ways to determine the start and end points of the loop. There are various situations that are more easily served by one type of loop over the others.

The statements for loops provided in JavaScript are:

 * for statement
  * do  ...while statement
* while statement
* labeled statement 
*  block statement
  *  continue statement 
   *   for...in statement
  *   for...of statement
