# React Native

## Review, Research, and Discussion 👍

Compare and Contrast Redux Toolkit with Redux “Ducks” 👍

* The Redux Toolkit generates the new state from the direct changes to the old state. ... The reducers that are written with immer are 2 to 3 times slower than a normal Redux reducer. Here is an example of a Reducer function that uses the state as immutable and one which makes changes directly to the state


What is the principle advantage of Redux Toolkit

* Redux Toolkit makes it easier to write good Redux applications and speeds up development, by baking in our recommended best practices, providing good default behaviors, catching mistakes, and allowing you to write simpler code. Redux Toolkit is beneficial to all Redux users regardless of skill level or experience.

### Document the following Vocabulary Terms 📑
|||
|-----|-----|
|redux toolkit slices|createSlice is a higher order function that accepts an initial state, an object full of reducer functions and a slice name. It automatically generates action creators and action types that correspond to the reducers and state|
|namespace|a set of signs (names) that are used to identify and refer to objects of various kinds.|

## Preparation Materials 📚

* React Native is like React, but it uses native components instead of web components as building blocks

* React Native provides a number of built-in Core Components ready for you to use in your app. You can find them all in the left sidebar (or menu above, if you are on a narrow screen). If you're not sure where to get started, take a look at the following categories:

  * Basic Components
   * User Interface
  * List Views
  * Android-specific
  * iOS-specific
  * Others


Are there differences between React and React Native to handle the state?​

 * there is no difference in handling the state between React and React Native. You can use the state of your components both in classes and in functional components using hooks!


 * Create native apps for Android and iOS using React
React Native combines the best parts of native development with React, a best-in-class JavaScript library for building user interfaces. [React Native](https://reactnative.dev/)
