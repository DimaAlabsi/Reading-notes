# AWS: Cloud Servers

## Review, Research, and Discussion üí¨

1.Describe the Web-Request-Response-Cycle?

* The request/response cycle traces how a user's request flows through the app. Understanding the request/response cycle is helpful to figure out which files to edit when developing an app (and where to look when things aren't working).

2.Explain what a ‚Äúserver‚Äù is, as it relates to the WRRC?

* All resources are hosted on a server. The server‚Äôs location on the web can be identified by its IP address, however, IP addresses aren‚Äôt particularly user friendly, and instead we use URLS (such as http://www.google.co.uk) to search for a resource.

3.What does it mean to ‚Äúdeploy‚Äù an application?


* Application Deployment (also referred to as Software Deployment) is the process of installing, configuring, and enabling a specific application or set of applications, usually through an application manager (app manager) or software management system, to a specific URL on a server.

* Amazon Elastic Compute Cloud (Amazon EC2) is a web service that provides secure, resizable compute capacity in the cloud. It is designed to make web-scale cloud computing easier for developers. Amazon EC2‚Äôs simple web service interface allows you to obtain and configure capacity with minimal friction. It provides you with complete control of your computing resources and lets you run on Amazon‚Äôs proven computing environment.

*  AWS Elastic Beanstalk is an easy-to-use service for deploying and scaling web applications and services developed with Java, . NET, PHP, Node. js, Python, Ruby, Go, and Docker on familiar servers such as Apache, Nginx, Passenger, and IIS.

* EC2 is Amazon's service that allows you to create a server (AWS calls these instances) in the AWS cloud. You pay by the hour and only what you use. You can do whatever you want with this instance as well as launch n number of instances. Elastic Beanstalk is one layer of abstraction away from the EC2 layer.
