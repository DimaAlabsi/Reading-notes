#  Local Storage

## 
THE PAST, PRESENT & FUTURE OF LOCAL STORAGE FOR WEB APPLICATIONS

+  The operating system typically provides an abstraction layer for storing and retrieving application-specific data like preferences or runtime state. 

+ "Historically, web applications have had none of these luxuries. Cookies were invented early in the web’s history, and indeed they can be used for persistent local storage of small amounts of data. But they have three potentially dealbreaking downsides:

Cookies are included with every HTTP request, thereby slowing down your web application by needlessly transmitting the same data over and over
Cookies are included with every HTTP request, thereby sending data unencrypted over the internet (unless your entire web application is served over SSL)
Cookies are limited to about 4 KB of data — enough to slow down your application (see above), but not enough to be terribly useful
What we really want is

a lot of storage space

on the client

that persists beyond a page refresh

and isn’t transmitted to the server

Before HTML5, all attempts to achieve this were ultimately 

unsatisfactory in different ways."
