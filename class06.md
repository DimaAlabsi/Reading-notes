# JS Object Literals; The DOM

:"     There are many common answers to this question:

+ Learning a new technology
+ Naming things
+ Testing your code
+ Debugging
+ Fixing bugs
+ Making software maintainable

figure out what the major components of the picture are
Sort the pieces by color or component
Put together all the border pieces
Put together each component of the picture from the piles you created
This all breaks down when you don’t have a picture with clear components that you can identify.

The same thing happens when writing code.  Writing code is a lot like putting together a jigsaw puzzle.  We put together code with the purpose of building components that we have taken out of the “bigger picture” of the problem domain.

The big issue is that many problem domains are like a puzzle with a blurry picture or no picture at all." [By John Sonmez

#### accesing elements:
+ SELECTING ELEMENTS USING ID ATTRIBUTES PR CLASS ATTRIBUTES
+ SELECTING AN ELEMENT by tag name, or
