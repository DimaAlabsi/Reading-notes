# Redux - Additional Topics

## Review, Research, and Discussion üëç

What‚Äôs the best practice for ‚Äúpre-loading‚Äù data into the store (on application start) in a Redux application?
The most 'redux-like' way of handling the pre-loading of data would be to fire off the asynchronous action in the lifecycle method (probably componentWillMount ) of a Higher Order Component that wraps your app

When using a thunk/async action that dispatches the actual action, which do you export from your reducer?


To dispatch async actions into our store, we have to apply the thunk middleware by writing: const store = createStore(joke, applyMiddleware(thunk)); to apply the middleware. Then in App , we call dispatch with the function returned from the fetchJoke passed inside

* State is the heart of each application and there is no quicker way to create buggy, unmanageable applications than by producing an inconsistent state or state that is out-of-sync with local variables that linger around.
