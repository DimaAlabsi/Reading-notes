## css

###### *CSS (Cascading Style Sheets) allows you to create great-looking web pages, but how does it work under the hood? This article explains what CSS is, with a simple syntax example, and also covers some key terms about the language*


  ###### *CSS can be used for very basic document text styling — for example changing the color and size of headings and links. It can be used to create layout — for example turning a single column of text into a layout with a main content area and a sidebar for related information. It can even be used for effects such as animation. Have a look at the links in this paragraph for specific examples*..

  #### Three Ways to Insert CSS

There are three ways of inserting a style sheet:

   * External CSS
   * Internal CSS
   * Inline CSS

| External CSS     |         With an external style sheet, you can change the look of an entire website by changing just one file!\ |  
|----------  |:-------------:|
| Internal CSS   |  An internal style sheet may be used if one single HTML page has a unique style. | 
| Inline CSS |    An inline style may be used to apply a unique style for a single element. |

The goal of a reset stylesheet is to reduce browser inconsistencies in things like default line heights, margins and font sizes of headings, and so on.
