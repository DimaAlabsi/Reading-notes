## Lists on html

**HTML provides us with three different types of lists** : 
 +  Ordered lists using < ol> tag ,  for numbers
+  Unordered lists using  < ul> tag, for  bullets 
+ Definition lists using < dl > tag, < dt> tag,  < dd>tag ; to define terminology

## Boxes on CSS
CSS treats each HTML element as if it has its own box.
Properties on css:

|  property| Description |
| ----------- | ----------- |
|  Width |  |
|  Height |this property simply hides any extra content that doesnot fit in the box. |
|hidden||
|scroll| This property adds a scrollbar to the box so that users can scroll to see the missing content.|
|display| allowsbyou to turn an inline element into a block-level element or vice versa.|
|visibility|allows you to hide boxes from users but It leaves a space where the element would have been.|
    

## Every box has three available  properties  that can be adjusted to control it's  appearance:

  1. boarder

+ The border-width property is used to control the width
of a border.
+ You can control the style of a
border using the border-style

+ You can specify the color of a
border using either RGB values,

2. Padding
 + padding property allows you to specify how much space should appear between the content of an element and its border.

3. Margin

+ The margin property controls
the gap between boxes. 


## JavaScript 

+ using an array whenever you are working
with a list or a set of values that
are related to each other. 



+ if â€¦ else statement allows youto provide two sets of code:
1. one set if the condition evaluates to true.
2. another set if the condition is false.

+ Due to type coercion, every value in JavaScript can be treated as if it were true or false; and this has some interesting side effects.


+ Conditional statements allow your code to make decisions about what to do next.
