### VERSION CONTROL
*Version control, also known as source control, is the practice of tracking and managing changes to software code*.

Use of Version Control System: 
 
 + A repository: It can be thought of as a database of changes. It contains all the edits and historical versions (snapshots) of the project.
 + Copy of Work (sometimes called as checkout): It is the personal copy of all the files in a project. You can edit to this copy, without affecting the work of others and you can finally commit your changes to a repository when you are done making your changes.

 | Type of versions:      | Description |
| ----------- | ----------- |
| Local Version Control Systems    | t is one of the simplest forms and has a database that kept all the changes to files under revision control.      | 
|   Centralized Version Control Systems:  |Centralized version control systems contain just one repository and each user gets their own working copy.    |

 ## What is Git?
