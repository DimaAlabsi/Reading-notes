***Roy Fielding is acomputer scientist, one of the principal authors of the HTTP specification and the originator of the Representational State Transfer (REST) architectural style. He is an authority on computer network architecture and co-founded the Apache HTTP Server project.***


**Roy Fielding is best known for his work in developing and defining the modern World Wide Web infrastructure by authoring the Internet standards for HTTP and Uniform Resource Identifiers (URI), for defining the REST architectural style, and as co-founder and former chairman of the Apache Software Foundation that produces the software for over 60% of public Internet web sites. He is also the founder of several open-source software projects, including the Apache HTTP Server Project. Roy still works on the Apache HTTP Server project.**

**HTTP, it's capable of all sorts of neat stuff that people ignore for some reason.**




*  **There's this concept that people are calling “Web Services” or "APIs". It means a lot of different things to a lot of different people but the basic concept is that machines could use the web just like people do.**

* **GET is the simplest type of HTTP request method; the one that browsers use each time you click a link or type a URL into the address bar. It instructs the server to transmit the data identified by the URL to the client. Data should never be modified on the server side as a result of a GET request. In this sense, a GET request is read-only.**

* ***The POST verb is mostly utilized to create new resources. In particular, it's used to create subordinate resources. That is, subordinate to some other (e.g. parent) resource.***

On successful creation, return HTTP status 201, returning a Location header with a link to the newly-created resource with the 201 HTTP status.

*  ***PUT is most-often utilized for update capabilities, PUT-ing to a known resource URI with the request body containing the newly-updated representation of the original resource.

* **DELETE is pretty easy to understand. It is used to delete a resource identified by a URI.**

### API is the acronym for Application Programming Interface, which is a software intermediary that allows two applications to talk to each other. Each time you use an app like Facebook, send an instant message, or check the weather on your phone, you're using an API.

"As long as everyone got a chance to talk, the team did well. But if only one person or a small group spoke all the time, the collective intelligence declined.’",

"‘‘I think, until the off-site, I had separated things in my head into work life and life life,’’ Laurent told me. ‘‘But the thing is, my work is my life. I spend the majority of my time working. Most of my friends I know through work. If I can’t be open and honest at work, then I’m not really living, am I?’’" ,

"‘Just having data that proves to people that these things are worth paying attention to sometimes is the most important step in getting them to actually pay attention,’’ Rozovsky told me. ‘‘Don’t underestimate the power of giving people a common platform and operating language.’’"
