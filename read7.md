 ## Expressions and operators

#### Operators


###### JavaScript has the following types of operators. This section describes the operators and contains information about operator precedence.

* Assignment operators

* Comparison operators

| Operator   |      description    |  example |
|----------|:-------------:|---------: |
| Equal (==) . |  	Returns true if the operands are equal |3 == var1 "3" == var1  3 == '3' |

* Arithmetic operators

* Bitwise operators

|  Operator 		  |  Usage          | Description  |
|----------|:-------------:|------:|
| Bitwise AND 	 |  a & b  | 	Returns a one in each bit position for which the corresponding bits of both operands are ones. |
| Bitwise OR 	. |   a\b   |  	Returns a zero in each bit position for which the corresponding bits of both operands are zeros |

* Logical operators
* String operators
* Conditional (ternary) operator
* Comma operator
* Unary operators
* Relational operators.

  ## Functions
 
  **Functions are one of the fundamental building blocks in JavaScript. A function in JavaScript is similar to a procedureâ€”a set of statements that performs a task or calculates a value, but for a procedure to qualify as a function, it should take some input and return an output where there is some obvious relationship between the input and the output. To use a function, you must define it somewhere in the scope from which you wish to call it.**

### The control flow is the order in which the computer executes statements in a script.
##### Code is run in order from the first line in the file to the last line, unless the computer runs across the (extremely frequent) structures that change the control flow, such as conditionals and loops. 
###### For example, imagine a script used to validate user data from a webpage form. The script submits validated data, but if the user, say, leaves a required field empty, the script prompts them to fill it in. To do this, the script uses a conditional structure or if...else, so that different code executes depending on whether the form is complete or not...
