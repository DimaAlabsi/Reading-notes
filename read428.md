# Component Lifecycle / useEffect()

## Review, Research, and Discussion 👍
Why do we not need more .html pages in a multi-page React app?

* A React app consists of a single HTML file index.html. The views are coded in JSX format as components.


If we wanted a component to show up on every page, where would we put it and why?
Outside the <BrowserRouter/>
Inside the <BrowserRouter />, outside a <Route />
Inside a <Route />
What does routing do with the components that were rendered when a new route is requested
What does props.children contain?
How do useState() and this.setState() differ?

### Document the following Vocabulary Terms 📑
|||
|-----|-----|
|Functional Components|Functional components are basic JavaScript functions. These are typically arrow functions but can also be created with the regular function keyword. Sometimes referred to as “dumb” or “stateless” components as they simply accept data and display them in some form; that is they are mainly responsible for rendering UI.|
|Children / Child Components|There is one prop that gets special treatment unlike all the others. That,Children allow you to pass components as data to other components, just like any other prop you use. The special thing about children is that React provides support through its ReactElement API and JSX. XML children translate perfectly to React children!|
