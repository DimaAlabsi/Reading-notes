# NODE.JS


##### Node.js® is a JavaScript runtime built on Chrome’s V8 JavaScript engine.


#####  is an open-source, cross-platform, back-end JavaScript runtime environment that runs on the V8 engine and executes JavaScript code outside a web browser. Node.js lets developers use JavaScript to write command line tools and for server-side scripting—running scripts server-side to produce dynamic web page content before the page is sent to the user's web browser.

* **V8 is an open-source JavaScript engine developed by the Chromium Project for Google Chrome and Chromium web browsers.**



####   Node is a JavaScript runtime

* ***Node.js is a JavaScript runtime environment that achieves low latency and high throughput by taking a “non-blocking” approach to serving requests. In other words, Node.js wastes no time or resources on waiting for I/O requests to return.***


 #### NPM 

 * ***Much of Node’s utility comes from its large package library, which is accessible from the npm command. NPM, the Node package manager, is part of the standard Node.js installation, although it has its own website.***

 * ***NPM can manage packages that are local dependencies of a particular project, as well as globally installed JavaScript tools. When used as a dependency manager for a local project, NPM can install, in one command, all the dependencies of a project through the package.json file. When used for global installations, NPM often requires system (sudo) privileges.***


 * The version of node are running on my machine is **v14.17.3** 

 * The version of npm are  running on my machine is **6.14.13**

 * The command  to install a library/package called ‘jshint’ : ***npm install -g jshint***


##### Node.js has inspired an ecosystem of more than a million packages that are registered and versioned in the NPM repository and can be installed using the NPM command line or an alternative such as Yarn.

**  Pair programming commonly involves two roles:
* The Driver and the Navigator : The Driver is the programmer who is typing and the only one whose hands are on the keyboard. 

* The Navigator uses their words to guide the Driver but does not provide any direct input to the computer.
