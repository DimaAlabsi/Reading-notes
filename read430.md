# Hash Tables

* Hashtables are a data structure that utilize key value pairs. This means every Node or Bucket has both a key, and a value.

* Hash - A hash is the result of some algorithm taking an incoming string and converting it into a value that could be used for either security or some other purpose. In the case of a hashtable, it is used to determine the index of the array.
* Buckets - A bucket is what is contained in each index of the array of the hashtable. Each index is a bucket. An index could potentially contain multiple key/value pairs if a collision occurs.
* Collisions - A collision is what happens when more than one key gets hashed to the same location of the hashtable.

### Internal Methods
 
* GetHash()
* Find()
* Add()

* Contains()

So üìî  

*  Hash table is a special collection that is used to store key-value items. So instead of storing just one value like the stack, array list and queue, the hash table stores 2 values. These 2 values form an element of the hash table..


* The idea behind a hash table is to figure out which box to put data by using only its name. This means, no matter how many boxes are filled up, you can always find information quickly if you have its name. The hash table uses a hash function to figure out which number to put data in from its name.
